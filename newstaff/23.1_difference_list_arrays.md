To summarize, the main differences with python lists are:

Arrays support vectorized operations, while lists donâ€™t.
Once an array is created, you cannot change its size. You will have to create a new array or overwrite the existing one.
Every array has one and only one dtype. All items in it should be of that dtype.
An equivalent numpy array occupies much less space than a python list of lists.
numpy arrays support boolean indexing.
